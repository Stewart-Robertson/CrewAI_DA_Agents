# Final Data Cleaning Summary for Superannuation Dataset

## 1. Initial Data Assessment Results
The Superannuation dataset captures personal, financial, and contact details of members. This report identifies observed data type inconsistencies and quality issues that require attention prior to analysis.

### Dataset Overview
- **Columns**: The dataset contains various columns such as member ID, name, date of birth, gender, employment status, salary, contribution rates, super balance, investment options, insurance coverage, beneficiary details, contact information, and address.

### Key Insights
1. **Demographics**: The dataset includes a diverse range of individuals with varying ages, genders, and employment statuses (employed, unemployed, self-employed).
2. **Financial Information**: 
   - Income varies significantly among members, with some entries showing no income.
   - Employer and employee contribution rates range from 0.0 to 0.198.
   - Members hold varying amounts in their superannuation accounts, with some having millions in assets.
3. **Data Quality Issues**: There are instances of missing data in certain fields, which may require attention during analysis.

## 2. Strategy for Handling Missing Values
- **Numerical Columns**: Imputation using the mean.
- **Categorical Columns**: Removal of rows with missing values.

## 3. Strategy for Standardising Data Types
- **member_id**: Integer (no issues).
- **first_name, last_name, etc.**: String (categorical/text) with missing entries.
- **date_of_birth**: Date (multiple formats present).
- **salary, contribution rates, super balance**: Numeric (float) with missing values.
- **insurance_coverage**: Expected Boolean but stored as strings.

## 4. Strategy for Standardising Formats
- **Date of Birth**: Parse to a uniform date format (ISO 8601).
- **Boolean Fields**: Convert `insurance_coverage` from strings to booleans.
- **Phone Numbers**: Apply consistent formatting rules.
- **Postal Codes**: Standardize formatting.

## 5. Strategy for Handling Duplicates
- **Identify Duplicates**: Use the `pandas` library to identify duplicates based on key columns.
- **Review Duplicates**: Determine which entry to retain based on additional fields.
- **Retention Criteria**: Retain the entry with the highest `super_balance` or most recent entry based on `date_of_birth`.

## 6. Strategy for Handling Outliers
- **Z-score Method**: Identify outliers with Z-scores > 3 or < -3.
- **IQR Method**: Identify outliers as values below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.
- **Actions**: Remove extreme outliers, apply transformations for moderate outliers, and set thresholds to cap extreme values.

## 7. Overall Summary of the Cleaning Process
This report outlines the strategies for addressing missing values, standardizing data types and formats, handling duplicates, and managing outliers in the Superannuation dataset. Implementing these strategies will ensure data integrity and prepare the dataset for reliable analysis.
