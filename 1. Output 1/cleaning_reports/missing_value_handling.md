Thank you for the detailed summary of our conversation and the dataset. Hereâ€™s a concise recap of the key points and actions taken:

### Summary of Actions and Findings

1. **Objective**: Understand the tasks and responsibilities of the team by analyzing the dataset related to superannuation members.

2. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - The dataset was read from a CSV file named `Superannuation.csv` using the pandas library in Python.

3. **Missing Values Analysis**:
   - A check for missing values was performed, calculating the percentage of missing values for each column.
   - A handling strategy was proposed: 
     - **Numerical Columns**: Imputation using the mean.
     - **Categorical Columns**: Removal of rows with missing values.

4. **Documentation**:
   - The results of the missing value analysis and the handling strategy were documented in a markdown file named `missing_value_handling.md`, saved in the `cleaning_reports/` folder.

5. **Dataset Overview**:
   - The dataset contains various attributes for each member, including:
     - Personal details (name, date of birth, gender)
