# Data Type and Consistency Analysis Report for Superannuation Dataset

## Overview
The dataset contains columns covering personal, financial, and contact information for superannuation members. Below is a detailed analysis of data types and inconsistencies observed.

## Column-wise Data Type Expectations and Issues

### 1. member_id
- Expected Type: Integer
- Observations: Appears consistent as integer IDs.
- Issues: None detected.

### 2. first_name, last_name, beneficiary_name, beneficiary_relationship, city, state, investment_option, gender, employment_status
- Expected Type: String (categorical/text)
- Observations: Mostly consistent text data.
- Issues:
  - Missing values in `gender` and `employment_status` fields.
  - Some `state` values appear non-standard (e.g., "X", "AN").
  - Some missing city fields.

### 3. date_of_birth
- Expected Type: Date
- Observations: Format is mixed but generally MM/DD/YYYY.
- Issues: Potential non-uniform formats; need parsing and standardization.

### 4. salary, employer_contribution_rate, employee_contribution_rate, super_balance
- Expected Type: Numeric (float)
- Observations:
  - Presence of missing values in `salary`.
  - Contribution rates range within expected decimals.
- Issues:
  - Missing values.
  - No obvious outliers but requires thorough analysis.

### 5. insurance_coverage
- Expected Type: Boolean
- Observations: Values as "true"/"false" strings.
- Issues:
  - Case sensitivity and consistency need confirmation.

### 6. contact_number
- Expected Type: String
- Observations: Phone numbers present in various formats including missing entries.
- Issues: Inconsistent formatting; some missing numbers.

### 7. email
- Expected Type: String
- Observations: Mostly valid email format.
- Issues: Verify for invalid emails if required.

### 8. address
- Expected Type: String
- Observations: Present but some missing entries.
- Issues: None significant.

### 9. postal_code
- Expected Type: String
- Observations: Contains numbers and letters; inconsistent formatting.
- Issues:
  - Spaces and non-numeric characters (e.g., "24053 CEDEX")
  - Needs standardization.

## Summary of Data Quality and Type Issues
- Missing values in multiple columns (`gender`, `employment_status`, `salary`, `contact_number`, `city`, `state`).
- Date format inconsistency requiring parsing.
- Boolean fields stored as strings.
- Phone numbers inconsistent in format.
- Postal code inconsistencies with alpha-numeric values.
- Potential non-standard state codes.

## Recommendations
- Parse and standardize `date_of_birth` to ISO format.
- Convert boolean string fields to actual boolean types.
- Standardize phone number formats or separate country codes if applicable.
- Address missing values strategically depending on analysis needs.
- Standardize postal codes and state abbreviations.
