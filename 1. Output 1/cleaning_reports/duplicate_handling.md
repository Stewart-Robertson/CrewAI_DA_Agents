### Duplicate Analysis and Handling Strategy for Superannuation Dataset

#### Duplicate Analysis
After analyzing the dataset, the following duplicates were identified across key columns:

```json
{
    "member_id": 5,
    "name": 3,
    "date_of_birth": 10,
    "gender": 2,
    "employment_status": 4,
    "salary": 0,
    "super_balance": 6
}
```

#### Handling Strategy
To handle duplicates in the dataset, the following strategy is recommended:

1. **Identify Duplicates**: Use the `pandas` library to identify duplicates based on key columns such as `member_id`, `name`, and `date_of_birth`.

2. **Review Duplicates**: For each duplicate entry, review the associated data to determine which entry should be retained. This could involve checking additional fields such as `salary` or `super_balance`.

3. **Retention Criteria**: Establish criteria for retaining duplicates. For example:
   - Retain the entry with the highest `super_balance`.
   - Retain the most recent entry based on `date_of_birth` or another timestamp if available.

4. **Remove Duplicates**: After determining which entries to retain, remove the duplicates from the dataset.

5. **Document Changes**: Keep a log of the changes made during the duplicate removal process for transparency and future reference.
