# Data Type and Consistency Analysis Report for Superannuation Dataset

## Overview
The Superannuation dataset captures personal, financial, and contact details of members. This report identifies observed data type inconsistencies and quality issues that require attention prior to analysis.

## Detailed Column Analysis

- **member_id**  
  Type: Integer  
  Issues: None.

- **first_name, last_name, beneficiary_name, beneficiary_relationship, city, state, investment_option, gender, employment_status**  
  Type: String (categorical/text)  
  Issues: Missing gender and employment_status entries; non-standard state entries (e.g., "X", "AN"); missing city entries.

- **date_of_birth**  
  Type: Date (expected)  
  Issues: Multiple date formats present; requires uniform parsing and conversion to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

- **salary, employer_contribution_rate, employee_contribution_rate, super_balance**  
  Type: Numeric (float)  
  Issues: Presence of null/missing salary values; ensure numeric conversion without errors.

- **insurance_coverage**  
  Type: Boolean expected  
  Issues: Recorded as string literals ("true"/"false"); conversion to boolean type needed with case normalization.

- **contact_number**  
  Type: String  
  Issues: Inconsistent phone number formatting and some missing values; recommend format standardization.

- **email**  
  Type: String  
  Issues: Mostly valid format; consider validation step for anomalies.

- **address**  
  Type: String  
  Issues: Some missing addresses; generally consistent.

- **postal_code**  
  Type: String  
  Issues: Inconsistent formatting with spaces, letters, and suffixes (e.g., "24053 CEDEX"); standardization necessary.

## Summary of Data Quality Issues

- Missing values in multiple columns are evident (gender, employment_status, salary, contact_number, city, state).
- Inconsistent date formats affecting the `date_of_birth` field.
- Boolean fields stored as strings, leading to potential misinterpretation.
- Heterogeneous phone number formats and occasional missing values.
- Postal codes showing varied formats, some with alphabetic suffixes.
- Non-standard state codes and abbreviations exist.

## Recommended Cleaning Strategies

1. **Date of Birth:** Parse to a uniform date format (ISO 8601).
2. **Boolean Fields:** Convert `insurance_coverage` from strings to booleans.
3. **Missing Values:** Impute or handle missing values appropriately based on column and analysis needs.
4. **Phone Numbers:** Apply consistent formatting rules or parse for normalization.
5. **Postal Codes:** Strip spaces, convert to uppercase, validate format, and handle exceptions like suffixes.
6. **Categorical Fields:** Standardize text entries in gender, employment_status, state.
7. **Data Types:** Explicitly cast each column to the correct type after cleaning.
