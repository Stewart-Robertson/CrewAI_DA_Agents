# Final Report on Superannuation Dataset Analysis

## Data Cleaning Summary
The data cleaning process involved several key actions:

1. **Initial Data Assessment**:
   - The dataset contains 500 rows and 20 columns with various data types.
   - Missing values were identified in the `gender`, `salary`, and `contact_number` columns.
   - No duplicates were found based on `member_id`.

2. **Missing Value Handling**:
   - Strategies for handling missing values were proposed, including imputation based on employment status or using placeholders.

3. **Data Type Standardization**:
   - Inconsistent date formats and gender representations were standardized.
   - String formats for contact numbers were made consistent.

4. **Outlier Handling**:
   - Outliers were detected using Z-score and IQR methods, with recommendations for capping or transforming extreme values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary
The exploratory data analysis revealed several insights:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Salary, employer contribution rate, employee contribution rate, and super balance were analyzed, highlighting the presence of outliers.

2. **Gender and Employment Status**:
   - The dataset shows a diverse representation of genders and employment statuses, indicating a need for sensitive handling in reporting.

3. **Correlation Insights**:
   - Higher salaries correlate with higher super balances, suggesting that income level is a critical factor in retirement savings.

## Visualisation Summary
(Note: The visualisation summary is currently unavailable, but it is expected to include insights from various visualizations created based on the dataset, such as distributions of age, salary, and employment status.)

## Critical Evaluation of Findings
The analysis indicates that while the dataset is rich in information, there are areas that require further investigation, particularly regarding missing values and outliers. The recommendations provided should be considered for improving data quality and analysis accuracy.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Implement the proposed strategies for handling missing values and outliers.
2. Conduct further analysis on the correlation between employment status and super balance growth.
3. Ensure that visualizations are created to effectively communicate insights from the dataset.

## Possibilities for Further Analysis
1. Explore the impact of age on contribution rates and retirement readiness.
2. Investigate economic trends reflected in the employment status of individuals in the dataset.
