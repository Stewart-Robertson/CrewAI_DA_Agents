# Duplicate Handling Strategy

## Duplicate Analysis
- **Duplicate Count**: 0 (No duplicates found)

## Handling Strategy
- **Recommended Strategy**: Since there are no duplicates in the dataset, it is crucial to maintain the uniqueness of the `transaction_id` in future data entries. Implement validation checks during data entry to ensure that each `transaction_id` is unique. If a duplicate is detected, prompt for a new `transaction_id` before allowing the entry to proceed.
