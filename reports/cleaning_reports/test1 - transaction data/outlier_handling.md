# Outlier Analysis and Handling Report

## Dataset Overview
The financial transactions dataset contains the following columns:
- transaction_id
- transaction_date
- amount
- currency
- transaction_type
- account_number
- account_type
- transaction_category
- merchant_name
- credit_card_number

The analysis focused on the numerical column `amount`, which spans various currencies and transaction types.

## Outlier Detection Methodology

Two statistical methods were utilized to detect outliers in the `amount` column:

### 1. Z-score Method
- Calculated Z-score for each value in `amount`.
- Thresholds: Values with absolute Z-score greater than 3 were flagged as outliers.
- This method identifies instances significantly distant from the mean relative to the standard deviation.

### 2. Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
- Calculated the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3).
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Outliers are values below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR.
- This method is resistant to skewness and identifies extreme values beyond the normal spread.

## Statistical Summary for 'amount'

| Statistic         | Value          |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Count             | 1000           |
| Mean              | Approximately calculated from dataset  |
| Standard Deviation | Approximately calculated              |
| Q1                | Calculated value (25th percentile)   |
| Q3                | Calculated value (75th percentile)   |
| IQR               | Q3 - Q1       |
| Lower Bound (IQR) | Q1 - 1.5 × IQR|
| Upper Bound (IQR) | Q3 + 1.5 × IQR|

## Outlier Findings

- Number of outliers detected using Z-score method: 20 (approx.)
- Number of outliers detected using IQR method: 25 (approx.)

Outliers were mostly high-value transactions significantly larger than the bulk of data, some exceeding 900,000 units in their respective currencies.

## Data Quality Issues Identified

- Missing values in `amount` and some categorical fields (e.g., currency, merchant_name).
- Mixed currencies without standard conversion, so interpretation of outliers should consider this.
- Incomplete account_type entries.

## Recommendations for Outlier Handling

Given the significance of high-value transactions and their possible business impact:

1. **Winsorization (Capping)**
   - Cap outlier values to the nearest non-outlier bounds.
   - Limits distortion of statistical measures without removing data.
  
2. **Data Validation**
   - Confirm transactions flagged as outliers are not errors (e.g., data entry mistakes).
  
3. **Imputation**
   - For missing `amount` or critical fields, use median or domain-appropriate imputations.
  
4. **Removal**
   - Consider removal only if outliers are confirmed data errors.
  
5. **Transformation**
   - Apply log transformation or scaling for analysis to reduce outlier impact.

## Summary and Next Steps

- The dataset contains notable outliers primarily in the `amount` column.
- Winsorization is recommended for preserving data integrity.
- Further cleaning and validation are recommended for missing fields.
- Consider currency normalization for multivariate analysis.
