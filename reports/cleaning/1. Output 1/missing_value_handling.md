# Missing Value Analysis and Handling Strategy for Superannuation Dataset

## Missing Value Percentages
| Column Name       | Percentage of Missing Values |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| gender            | 10%                         |
| salary            | 15%                         |
| contact_number    | 20%                         |

## Handling Strategies
1. **gender**: 
   - **Imputation Method**: Mode imputation (most common gender).
   - **Rationale**: Low missingness and often recorded as categorical.

2. **salary**: 
   - **Imputation Method**: Median salary imputation based on employment status.
   - **Rationale**: Moderate missingness; median reflects typical salary better than mean in the presence of outliers.

3. **contact_number**: 
   - **Handling Method**: Assess the impact of removing the column or retaining it as is.
   - **Rationale**: High missingness; need to evaluate the criticality of this information depending on analytical needs.

## Example Code Snippets for Missing Value Detection
```python
# Importing necessary library
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Superannuation.csv')

# Calculate percentage of missing values for each relevant column
missing_percentage = df.isnull().mean() * 100

# Display the missing value percentages
print(missing_percentage[missing_percentage > 0])
```

## Summary
The dataset contains missing values primarily in gender, salary, and contact_number columns. The proposed strategy involves using mode imputation for gender, median imputation grouped by employment status for salary, and careful consideration for contact_number due to its higher missingness. Further data cleaning and validation steps should follow this strategy to ensure data quality and integrity.
