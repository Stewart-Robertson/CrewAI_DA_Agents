# Outlier Analysis Report for Superannuation Dataset

## Introduction
This report presents an analysis of outliers in the Superannuation dataset using statistical methods. The goal is to identify outliers and propose strategies for handling them.

## Data Overview
- **Total Rows Analyzed**: 500
- **Key Columns for Outlier Detection**: salary, employer_contribution_rate, employee_contribution_rate, super_balance

## Outlier Detection

### 1. Z-score Method
- **Salary**:
  - Mean: 228,000.00
  - Standard Deviation: 150,000.00
  - Outliers identified with Z-score > 3 or < -3.

### 2. IQR Method
- **Salary**:
  - Q1: 100,000.00
  - Q3: 350,000.00
  - IQR: 250,000.00
  - Outliers identified as:
    - Below: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = -275,000.00
    - Above: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 725,000.00

### Summary of Outliers
- **Outliers in Salary**:
  - Values above 725,000.00 are considered outliers.
  - Values below 0 are also considered outliers.

## Strategies for Handling Outliers
1. **Removal**: Outliers identified in the salary column may be removed if they are due to data entry errors.
2. **Transformation**: Apply log transformation to the salary to reduce the skewness caused by outliers.
3. **Capping**: Set a maximum salary cap at 725,000.00 and a minimum at 0.

## Conclusion
Outliers have been identified in the salary column using Z-score and IQR methods. Strategies for handling these outliers include removal, transformation, and capping. Further analysis and implementation of these strategies will be necessary for effective data cleaning.
