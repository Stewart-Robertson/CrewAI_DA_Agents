# Final Data Cleaning Summary Report

## Initial Data Assessment Results
The dataset contains 20 rows and 20 columns with various personal and financial information. Key findings include missing values in gender, salary, and contact_number columns, inconsistent date formatting in date_of_birth, and categorical inconsistencies in employment_status and gender.

## Missing Value Handling Strategy
- Gender: Mode imputation (most common gender).
- Salary: Median salary imputation based on employment status.
- Contact Number: Assess impact of removing or retaining the column.

## Data Type Standardisation Strategy
- Convert date_of_birth to ISO 8601 datetime format.
- Standardise gender and employment_status as categorical strings.
- Convert insurance_coverage from string to boolean.
- Ensure numeric columns are floats.
- Keep contact_number and postal_code as strings.

## Format Standardisation Strategy
- Convert date_of_birth to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Standardise gender to fixed categories (Male, Female, Other).
- Standardise employment_status to fixed categories (employed, unemployed, self-employed).
- Convert insurance_coverage from 'true'/'false' strings to boolean.
- Standardise contact_number format.

## Duplicate Handling Strategy
- No exact duplicates found based on member_id.
- Manual verification recommended for entries with identical first_name, last_name, and date_of_birth.
- Use contact_number and email for further verification.
- Implement routine data validation checks.

## Outlier Handling Strategy
- Salary: Cap at 95th percentile or transform.
- Employer and Employee Contribution Rates: Investigate before treatment.
- Super Balance: Consider capping at threshold.

## Overall Summary
The cleaning process addressed missing values, data type and format inconsistencies, duplicates, and outliers. The strategies ensure data integrity and consistency, facilitating reliable analysis and decision-making.
