## Data Quality Metrics:
- **Total Rows:** 500
- **Total Columns:** 20
- **Missing Values:**
  - **gender:** Missing for rows 6 and 7
  - **salary:** Missing for rows 5, 6, and 16
  - **contact_number:** Missing for rows 5, 8, 17, and 19
- **Duplicates:** No duplicates found based on member_id
- **Data Type Inconsistencies:** Potential inconsistencies in gender representation (missing values).

## Initial Findings
1. The dataset contains various types of potentially sensitive information, including personal and financial data.
2. Missing values in the gender, salary, and contact_number columns need investigation and appropriate handling strategies.
3. The date formatting for date_of_birth needs to be consistent (currently appears as MM/DD/YYYY).
4. Employment status and other categorical values need to be checked for consistency.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis
1. Implement imputation strategies for missing values, possibly by grouping by employment status or other relevant features.
2. Validate and standardize gender representation (e.g., ensure consistent use of "Male," "Female," etc.).
3. Consider reformatting date fields into a standard date format for analysis.
4. Create a strategy for handling errors in the contact_number field (e.g., validating against known patterns).
5. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on salary and super_balance to uncover any potential outliers or trends.
