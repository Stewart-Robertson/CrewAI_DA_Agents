# Missing Value Analysis Report

## Summary of Missing Values
- **gender:** Missing for rows 6 and 7
- **salary:** Missing for rows 5, 6, and 16
- **contact_number:** Missing for rows 5, 8, 17, and 19

## Findings
1. **Gender:**
   - Missing values in the gender column can be handled by imputation. Possible strategies include:
     - Imputing with the mode (most common value) of the gender column.
     - Imputing based on employment status, as certain genders may be more prevalent in specific employment categories.

2. **Salary:**
   - Missing values in the salary column can be addressed through:
     - Imputation using the mean or median salary of the respective employment status.
     - Alternatively, if the missing values are concentrated in specific employment categories, we could use the average salary of those categories.

3. **Contact Number:**
   - Missing values in the contact_number column can be handled by:
     - Imputation with a placeholder (e.g., "N/A") if the contact number is not critical for analysis.
     - Alternatively, if there are patterns in the data, we could explore generating plausible contact numbers based on existing formats.

## Proposed Strategy for Handling Missing Values
- **Gender:**
  - Impute missing values with the mode of the gender column or based on employment status.
- **Salary:**
  - Impute missing values using the median salary for the respective employment status.
- **Contact Number:**
  - Impute missing values with "N/A" or a placeholder.
