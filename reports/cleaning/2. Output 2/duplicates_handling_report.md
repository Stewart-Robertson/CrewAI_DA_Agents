# Superannuation Dataset Duplicate Handling Report

## Summary of Findings
- **Duplicates Found**: No duplicates found based on `member_id`.

## Strategy for Handling Duplicates (if found)
1. **Keep First Occurrence**: Retain the first occurrence of the duplicate and remove subsequent entries.
2. **Aggregate Data**: If duplicates contain different values in other columns, consider aggregating the data (e.g., taking the average of numerical values).
3. **Flag for Review**: Flag duplicates for manual review to determine the best course of action based on business rules.
