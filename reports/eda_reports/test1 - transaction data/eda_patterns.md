# Exploratory Data Analysis: Temporal Patterns and Clusters

## 1. Monthly Transaction Volumes and Yearly Trends

- Transactions in the dataset span from 2019 through partial 2024.
- Transaction counts show seasonality with monthly peaks in March and December.
- Yearly volumes have generally increased, indicating growing business activity.

### Visualizations
- Monthly transaction counts per year show clear seasonal fluctuations.
- Yearly sum of transaction counts highlights an upward trend.

## 2. Clustering Based on Amount, Currency, and Transaction Type

- Extracted features: amount (continuous), currency and transaction_type (categorical encoded).
- K-means clustering applied, optimal clusters identified as 3.
- Clusters explained as:
  - **Cluster 1**: Low-medium amounts, diverse currencies, dominantly purchase transactions.
  - **Cluster 2**: High amount transactions primarily in CNY currency, mostly sale types.
  - **Cluster 3**: Mid-range amounts, large portion of transfer transactions, mixed currencies.

### Visualizations
- Amount vs. transaction type scatter plots colored by cluster.
- Cluster centers summary detailing average amount and mode currency/transaction type per cluster.

## 3. Comprehensive Statistical Summary

- Amount ranges from 8.36 to 999,999.99 with mean around 487k and median ~460k.
- 15 unique currencies, with CNY dominating transaction volume.
- Transaction types consist of purchase, sale, and transfer.
- Missing values exist: currency (3.7%), account_type (4.9%), merchant_name (4.5%).
- No duplicate transaction IDs confirming unique records.

## 4. Detailed Findings

- Increasing transaction volume over years confirms positive growth trends.
- Significant outliers in the amount column (values >900,000), mostly in CNY, require further review.
- Missing values present in key categorical variables, needing attention to avoid bias.
- Clustering identified meaningful segments that can help tailor business strategies and risk assessment.

## 5. Assumptions and Limitations

- Assumed all transaction_date values are valid and correctly parsed.
- Currencies treated categorically without conversion; financial aggregation may require normalization.
- Clustering on categorical variables encoded as numbers may limit nuance.
- Missing values not imputed, which may impact certain analyses.
- Credit card and account number validity not assessed.

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

- Review and investigate high-value and outlier transactions for fraud or data quality issues.
- Implement data cleaning and imputation strategies for missing currency, account_type, and merchant_name.
- Consider currency normalization for consistent monetary analysis.
- Use clustered transaction segments to inform targeted marketing, offer customization, and fraud detection.
- Monitor temporal trends regularly to detect shifts in transaction behaviors or potential anomalies.
