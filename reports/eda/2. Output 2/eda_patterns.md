## Temporal Patterns
### Date of Birth Analysis
The dataset contains a range of birth dates from 1900 to 2024. The distribution of ages indicates a significant number of individuals are in their 30s to 50s, suggesting a workforce that is predominantly middle-aged. This may have implications for retirement planning and superannuation contributions.

### Employment Status Trends
The employment status shows a mix of employed, unemployed, and self-employed individuals. Notably, there is a higher representation of employed individuals in the age group of 30-50, which aligns with typical career progression stages.

## Clusters
### Salary Clusters

- **Low Salary**: Individuals earning below $50,000, primarily in the unemployed category.
- **Middle Salary**: A significant cluster around $200,000 to $300,000, which includes a mix of employed and self-employed individuals.
- **High Salary**: A smaller cluster of high earners above $400,000, mostly self-employed or in high-level positions.
