## Insights and Recommendations
1. **Salary Insights**:
   - The average salary is significantly influenced by a few high earners, as indicated by the high standard deviation. This suggests the presence of outliers.
   - Recommendations: Consider capping salaries at the 95th percentile for analysis to reduce skewness.

2. **Employer Contribution Rate**:
   - The distribution shows a concentration around the mean, but there are some outliers that need further investigation.
   - Recommendations: Investigate the outlier further before deciding to remove or transform.

3. **Employee Contribution Rate**:
   - Similar to the employer contribution rate, further investigation is recommended for the outlier.

4. **Super Balance**:
   - The super balance has some extreme values that can distort analysis; capping or transformation is appropriate.
   - Recommendations: Investigate the outlier further before deciding on handling strategies.
