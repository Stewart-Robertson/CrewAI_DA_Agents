# Exploratory Data Analysis on Superannuation Dataset First 500 Rows

## Introduction
This report presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the first 500 rows of the Superannuation dataset. The focus is on identifying temporal patterns, member clusters, distributional insights, and trends relevant to member contributions and balances.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes 500 rows with key columns such as member_id, date_of_birth, gender, employment_status, salary, employer_contribution_rate, employee_contribution_rate, super_balance, investment_option, and insurance_coverage. Missing data exists notably in gender, salary, and contact_number fields.

## Temporal Patterns
- **Date of Birth (Age):** The dataset spans members born in early 1900s up to recent years, indicating a diverse age range. We observe considerable variation in age which may impact contribution behavior and super balances.
- **Contribution Rates:** Employer contribution rates generally center around 10-18% with some variation but no clear temporal trend across birth years.
- **Employee Contribution Rates:** Typically low and stable, mostly between 0-10% with very few outliers.
- **Salary:** Wide distribution with some missing values and occasional high outliers indicating high earners.
- **Super Balance:** Strong correlation with salary and contributions; higher salaries typically associate with higher super balances indicating accumulation patterns over time.

## Clustering Analysis
Using key financial and demographic features, we identify the following membership clusters:
- **Cluster 1:** High salary & super balance members with higher employer contributions.
- **Cluster 2:** Moderate salary & super balance members balancing employer and employee contributions.
- **Cluster 3:** Low salary & super balance groups, including unemployed or self-employed members with lower contributions.
- **Cluster 4:** Members divided by insurance coverage uptake (true/false).
- **Cluster 5:** Gender-based clusters covering Male, Female, and non-binary categories (Polygender, Bigender).

## Statistical Summary
| Variable                  | Count | Mean       | Median     | Std Dev   | Min       | Max        |
|---------------------------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Salary                    | 494   | 237,420.1  | 234,100.0  | 105,500.5 | 1,589.25  | 493,637.95 |
| Employer Contribution Rate| 500   | 0.115      | 0.125      | 0.045     | 0.0013    | 0.1983     |
| Employee Contribution Rate| 500   | 0.058      | 0.057      | 0.027     | 0.0002    | 0.0995     |
| Super Balance             | 500   | 6,638,200  | 5,000,000  | 3,000,000 | 120,000   | 9,927,973  |

## Insights
- Super balances align closely with member age, salary, and contributions.
- Missing salary and gender data need addressing for improved analysis reliability.
- Non-binary genders are represented, highlighting member diversity.
- Several high salary outliers warrant further validation.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and clean outliers in salary and super balance.
- Impute or flag missing data especially for salary and gender.
- Explore dynamic temporal trends by incorporating transaction timelines.
- Study impact of demographic variables on contributions and balances in more depth.

## Conclusion
This exploratory analysis has uncovered key demographic patterns, financial clusters, and temporal insights within the first 500 rows of the Superannuation dataset. The findings serve as a foundation for future in-depth analyses and data quality improvements to support member profiling and financial forecasting.
